# Building an E-Commerce clothing classifier model using CNNs.

Fashion Forward is a new AI-based e-commerce clothing retailer. They want to use image classification to automatically categorize new product listings, making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for. It will also assist in inventory management by quickly sorting items.

I will build, train and evaluate a convolutional neural network using the data from Fashion-MNIST and Python (PyTorch).
